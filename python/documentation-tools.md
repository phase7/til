## Smarter documentation with Documentation Tools

I stumbled across [JSDoc](https://github.com/phase7/til/blob/master/javascript/jsdoc.md) and was wondering if pyhton had any (of course it did!). So I've found a list of simillar documentation tools. 

>This page is primarily about tools that help, specifically, in generating documentation for software written in Python, i.e., tools that can use language-specific features to automate at least a part of the code documentation work for you. The last section also lists general documentation tools with no specific support for Python (though some of them are themselves written in Python).
