## ORM Object Relational Mapping/Mappers

ORMs are simplified ways to handle database operation. ORMs helps to boost productivity by connecting database to backends using an abstract class in between. Django uses Django ORM by default. 

Python ORM libraries are not required for accessing relational databases. In fact, the low-level access is typically provided by another library called a database connector, such as psycopg (for PostgreSQL) or MySQL-python (for MySQL). Take a look at the table below which shows how ORMs can work with different web frameworks and connectors and relational databases.

The ability to write Python code instead of SQL can speed up web application development, especially at the beginning of a project. The potential development speed boost comes from not having to switch from Python code into writing declarative paradigm SQL statements. While some software developers may not mind switching back and forth between languages, it's typically easier to knock out a prototype or start a web application using a single programming language.
