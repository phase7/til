## JSDo - Javascript API documentation generator

I've always seen formatted comments in code online. Like
```javascript
/**
 * Represents a book.
 * @constructor
 * @param {string} title - The title of the book.
 * @param {string} author - The author of the book.
 */
function Book(title, author) {
}
```
But never knew they were not just decorations and easy to understand documentation for the code, but had ther refined purpose. **JSDoc** can take these and make a complete documentation website. [details of JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/). Apparently this is available for other languages like PHP and Python.
